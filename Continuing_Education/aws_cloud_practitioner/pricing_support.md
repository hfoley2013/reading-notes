## Notes

### AWS Free Tier

The [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period. 

Three types of offers are available: 

* Always Free
* 12 Months Free
* Trials

For each free tier offer, make sure to review the specific details about exactly which resource types are included. 

**Always Free**
These offers *do not expire* and are available to all AWS customers.

For example, **AWS Lambda allows *1 million* free requests** and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month. Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month.

**12 Months Free**
These offers are free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS.

Examples include specific amounts of Amazon S3 Standard Storage, thresholds for monthly hours of Amazon EC2 compute time, and amounts of Amazon CloudFront data transfer out.

**Trials**
Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.

For example, Amazon Inspector offers a 90-day free trial. Amazon Lightsail (a service that enables you to run virtual private servers) offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period.

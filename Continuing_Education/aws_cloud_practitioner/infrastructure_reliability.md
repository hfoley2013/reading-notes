## Summary

### Regions

* AWS builds regions where there is the expected highest business traffic
* You get to choose the region that you belong to
* Data doesn't move from one region to another without your permission
* 4 Business Factors for Selecting a Region:
  1. Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
  2. Proximity to your customers
     * Reduce latency
  3. Feature Availability / Available services within a Region
     * Not all features are available in each region
  4. Pricing
     * Some locations are more or less expensive than others

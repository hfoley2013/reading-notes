## Notes

### Reasons

1. Greater efficiency
   * Takes longer to write, but is less error prone and results in reduced time spent debugging
   * Two programmers talking aloud to each other arrive at solutions to problems faster
2. Engaged collaboration
   * With someone else working with you, you are more likely to stay on task and get the job done
   * It's more fun working with others than alone
   * Allows you to ask for help and work through solutions together
3. Learning from fellow students
   * Other students learn differently and may be able to explain a problem in a way that makes more sense to you
   * Other students may have complementary skills and you can teach other
4. Social skills
   * Forces you to interact with other people
   * Communication is key in coding; remember: coding is collaborative
5. Job interview readiness
   * Interviews require you to talk aloud and work through a problem with your interviewer
   * Practicing communicating exactly how you are thinking about a problem and what approach you are about to take is key in interviews
6. Work environment readiness
   * Repeat: coding is collaborative
   * You need to be able to work with others on the job

## Notes

* Good teams and bad teams are created by group norms, not necessarily by the talent of the team members alone
* Google found two key traits in highly successful teams:
  1. **Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking**
     * Each member of the team spoke in roughly the same proportion
  2. **High Average Social Sensitivity**
     * Team members we good at intuiting how others felt based on their verbal and non-verbal cues
* The overall findings of Google point to a few things:
  * Staying strictly "on topic" stifles creativity and doesn't do much for creating a sense of team
  * A free flowing discussion in which each member of the team speaks as much as they need to is more conducive to building team performance
    * This is because when team members feel heard and respected, they are more willing to see their efforts as meaningful to the team as a whole and, therefore, contribute more ideas than they would otherwise
* Why is this important to know?
  * As SDEs we will be working on teams to solve complex problems
  * It is imperative that our teams create a feeling of psychological safety so that *all* team members feel comfortable bringing their ideas forward to the group
  * When everyone knows that their ideas will be heard out, discussed, and given fair critique, they are more likely to contribute their best ideas and help the team succeed

### What is Grid?

* Grid is a two-dimensional layout, compared to `Flexbox`'s one-dimensional layout
* `display: grid;` defines the **grid container**
* `grid-template-columns` & `grid-template-rows` set the width and height, respectively
* The order of your columns and rows doesn't matter, as CSS can make them display in any order

## How to Start to Design a Website

* **Project Ideation**

* Semantic Elements
  
  ``` html
  <article>
  <aside>
  <details>
  <figcaption>
  <figure>
  <footer>
  <header>
  <main>
  <mark>
  <nav>
  <section>
  <summary>
  <time>
  ```

## What is JavaScript

* JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted scripting language that allows you to interact with a webpage
* Allows the website to store values inside variables and use them to provide outputs to the user or change the webpage
* Common use of JS is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface via the Document Object Model API
* Added into the HTML document via the `<script>` tag
* Using `addEventListener`
  
  ``` js
    const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');

  for (const button of buttons) {
    button.addEventListener('click', createParagraph);
  }
  ```

* Script Loading Strategies
  
  ``` js
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // â€¦
  });
  ```

  * `defer` attribute tells the browser to continue downloading the HTML content once the `<script>` tag element has been reached
  
  ``` js
  <script src="script.js" defer></script>
  ```

* `async` attribute tells the browser to download the script without blocking the page while the script is being fetched
  * Best to use `async` when the scripts in the page run independently from each other and depend on no other script on the page
    * Ex: When you have a bunch of background scripts to load in, and you want them loaded as soon as possible

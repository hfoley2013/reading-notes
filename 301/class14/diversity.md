## Questions

### That Time When Women Stopped Coding

* **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**
  * Personal Computers became more available and were adopted by primarily male users since they were essentially primitive video game consoles
  * This lead to the stereotype of the nerdy/geek computer genius working alone in his basement
  * This image did not appeal to most women and so they came to believe that computer science was not something for them, but rather for those nerdy/geek geniuses
* **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**
  * Since males grew up playing on computers they were more familiar with their use and how they worked
  * This gave them an advantage when they went to university since professors began to assume that their students had prior computer experience
  * This lead to women not feeling comfortable asking questions about computers and caused them to fall further behind or drop out of CS programs

### Why Diversity Matters to your Tech Company

* **When are diversity efforts most successful?**
  * Diverse teams become more effective than homogenous teams when tasks become increasingly complex and a wider array of skill sets and experiences are needed to find the best solution 
* **Why do diverse companies perform better?**
  * More diverse companies are drawing from a wider talent pool and are thus more likely to have the best talent working for them
* **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
  * A diverse company can create more products to cater to a more diverse user base, solving each population's unique or niche needs

## Assignments

### Component Based Architecture

* **What is a “component”?**
  * A modular, well-defined piece of functional code that can be deployed independently and easily transferred to another application or replaced entirely
* **What are the characteristics of a component?**
  * **Reusability**
    * Can be reused across different applications
  * **Replaceable**
    * Can be freely substituted with other similar components
  * **Not context dependant**
    * Designed to operate in different environments
  * **Extensible**
    * Can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior
  * **Encapsulated**
    * Depicts the interface, but does not expose details of the internal processes, variables, or states
  * **Independent**
    * Minimal dependencies on other components
* **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**
  * By packaging these components together by function, this maximizes **component reusability**, resulting in:
    * Reduced time in the market and development costs due to the reuse of existing components
    * Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components
  * **Ease of deployment**
    * As updates occur, can easily replace existing components without impacting other components
  * **Reduced cost**
    * Can use 3rd party components to spread out the cost of development and maintenance
  * **Ease of development**
    * Can focus on development of a part of the app without impacting other components
  * **Reuseable**
    * Can take a component a use in other applications, further reducing development and maintenance costs
  * **Modification of technical complexity**
  * **Reliability**
    * The overall system reliability increases with the reliability of each individual component
  * **System maintenance and evolution**
    * Again, because each component is independent, you can conduct maintenance without interfering with the rest of the system
  * **Independent**
    * Because each component can be developed and deployed independently of the others, can speed up development and deployment and increase productivity of the development process

### What is Props and How to Use in React

* **What is “props” short for?**
* **How are props used in React?**
* **What is the flow of props?**

## Notes

### What is Component-based Architecture

* Focuses on breaking down design of a system into function or logical components
* These components are well-defined communication interfaces consisting of methods, event, and properties
* By packaging these components together by function, this maximizes **component reusability**, resulting in:
  * Reduced time in the market and development costs due to the reuse of existing components
  * Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components

### Components

* Well-defined, functional blocks of code that is easily deployable across different apps and easily replaceable due to its modular design
* Have **3x views**:
  1. **Object-Oriented**
     * Components are viewed as cooperating classes
     * Defines interfaces that enable classes to communicate and cooperate
  2. **Conventional**
     * Components are viewed as functional elements or modules that integrate processing logic
  3. **Process-Related**
     * Systems builds components from existing components maintained in a library, rather than building each component from scratch
* Characteristics of Components
  * **Reusability**
    * Can be reused across different applications
  * **Replaceable**
    * Can be freely substituted with other similar components
  * **Not context dependant**
    * Designed to operate in different environments
  * **Extensible**
    * Can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior
  * **Encapsulated**
    * Depicts the interface, but does not expose details of the internal processes, variables, or states
  * **Independent**
    * Minimal dependencies on other components
* Advantages of Component-Based Design
  * **Ease of deployment**

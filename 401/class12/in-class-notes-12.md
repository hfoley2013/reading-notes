# In-Class Notes: Pandas / Lab 12

* Use `.head()` to get a sense of what your data looks like before manipulation
  * `df.head()` will return the top 5 rows and all the columns in the document
* `.tail()` functions in a similar manner, but will return the bottom 5 rows
* **NOTE:** `head` and `tail` take the number of rows you wish to see as arguments:
  * `.tail(10)` will show you the last 10 rows of the document

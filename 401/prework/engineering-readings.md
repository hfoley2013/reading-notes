## Submission

* **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**
  * I bring a unique background that is rooted in complex problem-solving, whether that was on the ranch, defusing bombs, or working in tech mergers and acquisitions.
  * Growing up on a small ranch is southwest Texas, we built everything that we needed from raw or scrap materials. I grew up building fences, livestock pens, areas, barns (using our own home-built crane!), etc. from scratch, using nothing more than my critical thinking ability to plan out what materials I needed to find in the scrap pile or buy from the hardware store.
  * In the Navy, my job as a bomb disposal officer required me to enter into the most dangerous environments on earth (and underwater!) to defuse unexploded ordnance. I usually only had a verbal description or a grainy photograph of the device as source material from which I could begin the process of determining how best to protect people and property from a potential explosion, come up with null hypothesis on how the device functioned, and begin the process of testing my hypothesis through the careful exploitation of the device.
  * During my time as a tech investment banker, my job was to analyze client companies' finances and find creative solutions to meet their operational needs and leverage their financial strengths.
  * The unique blend of experiences that I have from resource-sparse ranch-hand engineering, high-stakes problem solving in high-risk, ambiguous environments as a bomb disposal technician, and financial engineering as an investment banker will be of huge value to any future employer.
* **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**
  1. Debug
     * Go step by step through the code and see where it breaks down
     * Once the break point is identified, I can start troubleshooting through testing multiple variations of the proceeding code until I get the effect that I want
  2. Reassess
     * Take a macro-view of the problem and consider if I am even going about solving my base problem the correct way
     * Examine is there is a better way to achieve the outcome that I am trying for in another manner
     * At the end of the day, the point is to get the code working
       * Making it pretty and more efficient will come later with refactoring
       * Don't get bogged down trying to do it perfect the first time
  3. Research
     * Google is your friend
     * Substack is your friend
     * W3 School is your friend
     * There are near infinite resources out there available to me and I assume at least one other person in the developer community has run into the exact issue I am trying to solve

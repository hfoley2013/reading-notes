## Notes

### In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

* TDD = Test Driven Development
* Write Tests first
* Give descriptive names to your tests
  * EX: `def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():`
* Name of the test module should follow the same name of the module to be tested
  * EX: module is `markets.py`, the test should be `test_markets.py`
* Structure of tests (AAA)
  * **Arrange**
    * Organize the data to execute the piece of code (input)
  * **Act**
    * Execute the code being tested (exercise the behavior)
  * **Assert**
    * Check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting

  ```py
  def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(‚ÄòAna‚Äô)
    assert expected_gender == ‚Äòfemale‚Äô
  ```

* The TDD Cycle
  * üÜò Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn‚Äôt there at first)
  * ‚úÖ Write the feature and make the test pass
  * üîµ Refactor the code

### What does the if __name__ == ‚Äú__main__‚Äù: do?

* Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
* If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
* If the module is being run standalone by the user then the module __name__ is ‚Äò__main__‚Äô and can do corresponding appropriate actions.
* if __name__ == ‚Äúmain‚Äù: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

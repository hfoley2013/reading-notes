## Behavioral Questions

### Tell me about a time in which you had to use your written communication skills in order to get across an important point.

* Situation
  * During my deployment in 2018 as a bomb disposal officer in the Navy, my team was tasked with a high-risk, high-profile mission to defuse and recover a first-of-its-kind explosive device. This device was in a sensitive political region in the Middle East and, therefore, had visibility up to the highest levels of government both in the U.S. and in the partner country. Long story short, after a whole series of unexpected events that naturally occur in the "fog of war", my team successfully defused and recovered the device. The evidence we recovered led directly to the destruction of a bomb making factory and the publication of a technical manual explaining how to defuse similar devices in the region.
* Task
  * As the officer in charge of my team, it was my responsibility to write up the award recommendations for my team members in order to ensure they got the recognition they deserved and help advance their promotion. However, the specific problem I encountered during my award write-ups what that despite conducting our operation in a war-torn region, because the area was not a declared "combat zone" by the U.S., my team was considered ineligible for higher-level awards associated with combat.
* Action
  * I knew that there had to be an exception to this "declared combat zone" requirement, or at least precedent for combat awards being given to actions taken in undeclared combat zone. I spent the next 72 hours essentially locked in my office researching the archive of awards kept by the military, as well as any mentions of personnel outside a combat zone receiving combat awards. I found precedent for an entire U.S. warship being awarded Combat Action Ribbons for shooting down incoming anti-ship missiles while off the coast of Yemen, an undeclared combat zone. Using the data gathered from my research, I wrote an 9-page white paper going over the requirements for the combat awards I was seeking, how my team met those requirements, and how there was existing precedent for not only a person, but a whole warship being granted combat awards for shooting down missiles in the middle of the ocean. If that counted as "combat action", so would defusing bombs while dodging armed enemy drones in a defacto war zone, I argued. 
* Result
  * After hand walking my white paper from my direct supervisor and explaining my findings, then my commanding officer, I then walked the report to the head of all naval forces in the Middle East and ensured it was left on his desk. My team had their awards in hand within a week, normally a months long process for combat awards.

### Give me an example of a time you had to make a difficult decision.

* Situation
  * As the officer in charge of a bomb disposal platoon preparing to deploy to the Middle East, I was faced with the difficult decision of cutting an under performing senior team member or retaining them for deployment. This individual's inability to obtain supervisory qualifications jeopardized the team's deployment readiness, however, it was unclear whether or not we'd be able to obtain a replacement before deployment.
* Task
  * My job as the officer in charge was to ensure the team had the resources required and training necessary to pass all pre-deployment evaluations of mission readiness. With only 3 of 4 team leaders qualified for supervisory positions as required by the DoD due to this senior team member's failure to perform, my team faced the very real possibility of not deploying. I needed to address how to best handle the senior team member and ensure deployment readiness.
* Action
  * With the ability to obtain a replacement in time, I took a bifurcated approach. First, was to bring up promising junior personnel to begin training to pass the various supervisory qualification boards we still needed to get to 4+ team leaders. This would increase our chances of obtaining the qualification and would also accelerate the career development of my best junior personnel. Second, I established a development plan for the under performing senior team member. This would allow me to formally document their lack of performance, track their progress during remediation training, and file to remove them from the team if they continued to under perform. However, if they "turned the ship around", this documentation would stay private and their career would not be impacted. I gave the team the goal to complete their training plans and obtain qualification in 3 months. At the end of that period, I would reevaluate the team's qualifications and make a decision on what to do with the struggling team member.<br>
  At the end of the period, the senior team member had only obtained 2 of 4 supervisory qualifications need to be certified as a team leader, while my two best junior sailors obtained their team lead certs. The team as a whole thought the senior member incompetent and that he should be removed from the team. The team felt strongly on this and really leveled the pressure to get me to kick them off the team. <br>
  However, due to his ability to obtain 50% of the prerequisite supervisory qualifications, I determined that he was on an upward trajectory and could still serve the team well as a team member, rather that a team leader. I went against the consensus of my team and kept him on.
* Result
  * The deployment was extremely successful and my team won many accolades. The under performing team member did not ultimately ever obtain his team leader certification and was released from service after our deployment. However, on deployment he was a valued team member. Because of his seniority, he was able to help the junior members who obtained their team leader certifications navigate the various databases and online tools we use to manage our personnel and equipment. Additionally, he put his ego aside and took direction from the younger team leaders and anticipated their needs while out on missions. He certainly directly enabled our success on deployment through his actions.

### Describe a situation when you had many projects due at the same time. What steps did you take to get them all done?

* Situation
  * As a financial analyst working in Tech M&A at Houlihan Lokey, the global leader in M&A transaction advisory by volume, I had to balance out creating and delivering updated financial models to clients, create and publish market research reports, and create various investor presentations for potential clients and buyers.
* Task
  * At one time, I was staffed on five different projects, each with its own timeline, importance to the firm, and deliverables. These included working on three "live deals" where I need to build complex financial models and presentations to advise C-Suite executives daily on companies they were looking at purchasing, one in-depth market research report on AI/ML companies, and one "pitch deck" to Warren Buffett. 
* Action
  * In order to successfully complete these projects, I spoke with my direct supervisor and laid out my priorities of work: 
    1. Financial model data comes first due to complexity of building the model and updating prior version since progress reports on model construction are required daily by the client.
    2. Build out the pitch deck for Warren Buffett since that project had a longer timeline, about 10 days, and had the potential to bring in ~$8 million in fees.
    3. Write and publish the market research report since it's not a revenue generating product for the firm.
  * He agreed that these were the appropriate priorities and I set off to work. Each day, I first completed financial model data and checked in with clients to ensure that they had all the information that they needed for the day and what additional data they would need tomorrow. <br>
  I then set a strict 5 hour time limit to work on the pitch to Warren Buffet every day and sent out working versions to the project manager to get their inputs every night. I followed up with this manager every morning to ensure the project was progressing at an appropriate pace and that the content in the presentation was meeting our firm's standards. <br>
  Lastly, since the market research report was due until the end of the quarter, about four weeks away, I allocated 2 hours per day to researching market data and wireframing the presentation design for the report. 
* Result
  * By getting clarification on priorities of work upfront when I was assigned these projects, I was able to simplify my decision-making process whenever two specific tasks on different projects conflict with each other time-wise. This resulted in all projects being completed on time with few last minute changes required. As a result of these specific projects, my contributions helped bring in ~$8 million in fees for the firm.

## Behavioral Questions

### Tell me about a time in which you had to use your written communication skills in order to get across an important point.

* Situation
  * During my deployment in 2018 as a bomb disposal officer in the Navy, my team was tasked with a high-risk, high-profile mission to defuse and recover a first-of-its-kind explosive device. This device was in a sensitive political region in the Middle East and, therefore, had visibility up to the highest levels of government both in the U.S. and in the partner country. Long story short, after a whole series of unexpected events that naturally occur in the "fog of war", my team successfully defused and recovered the device. The evidence we recovered led directly to the destruction of a bomb making factory and the publication of a technical manual explaining how to defuse similar devices in the region.
* Task
  * As the officer in charge of my team, it was my responsibility to write up the award recommendations for my team members in order to ensure they got the recognition they deserved and help advance their promotion. However, the specific problem I encountered during my award write-ups what that despite conducting our operation in a war-torn region, because the area was not a declared "combat zone" by the U.S., my team was considered ineligible for higher-level awards associated with combat.
* Action
  * I knew that there had to be an exception to this "declared combat zone" requirement, or at least precedent for combat awards being given to actions taken in undeclared combat zone. I spent the next 72 hours essentially locked in my office researching the archive of awards kept by the military, as well as any mentions of personnel outside a combat zone receiving combat awards. I found precedent for an entire U.S. warship being awarded Combat Action Ribbons for shooting down incoming anti-ship missiles while off the coast of Yemen, an undeclared combat zone. Using the data gathered from my research, I wrote an 9-page white paper going over the requirements for the combat awards I was seeking, how my team met those requirements, and how there was existing precedent for not only a person, but a whole warship being granted combat awards for shooting down missiles in the middle of the ocean. If that counted as "combat action", so would defusing bombs while dodging armed enemy drones in a defacto war zone, I argued. 
* Result
  * After hand walking my white paper from my direct supervisor and explaining my findings, then my commanding officer, I then walked the report to the head of all naval forces in the Middle East and ensured it was left on his desk. My team had their awards in hand within a week, normally a months long process for combat awards.
